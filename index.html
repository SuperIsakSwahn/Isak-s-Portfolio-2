  <p>I will now show two photos. Make sure you look at them carefully. One is a cat, and the other is me hugging a minigun I've wanted since I was maybe ten/eleven.</p>

  <p>But that's not the only things I enjoy, I also like Minecraft manhunt although I lack friends to play with, but I have played it in the past, for example the 2 hunters video where they said "Let's go du kommer dö" and I got full diamond armor and they rage quit, or the 2 hunters rematch where I spawned a wither.</p>
  <p>I also like the Dream vs Daquavis manhunt. SPOILER WARNING: I am pretty sure that Dream won, because he picked the best players in Minecraft to train him, while the guy training Daquavis is just an idiot known as kqwod. Next time be more careful with the teacher to pick, Daquavis..</p>
  <p>Let's hear a story (author is Isak Swahn)</p>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a curious little school boy named Isak, also known as PolishGuy by his Steam Alias.</p>
  <p>He spent every second of his life watching NISLT and saw a video called "TF2: How to get Australium Minigun [FUN]", and in that video, he saw an australium minigun, which he instantly fell in love with and craved.</p>
  <p>For an unknown amount of time, up to eight and a half years, he wanted it. He had owned australium miniguns but then he discovered that there's more, there are ones with perfect parts, spells, things he did not know existed when he was little.</p>
  <p>A couple months after buying the first regular australium minigun, he bought a spelled one, and it was his biggest trade yet, it consisted of 220 keys in items, one being his pro killstreak australium minigun without exorcism, for a specialized killstreak australium minigun with one.</p>
  <p>Then one day, while streaming with his minigun, and dominating everyone with his amazingly accurate headshots, he almost lost it all. He nearly got f##ked like the heavy in NISLT's video he had watched for so long, which would be painful considering he had 8.5 years to prepare for that. Luckily he turned around RIGHT when he should and lived, sending yeonshadowmoon (now named Lunar) to hell.</p>
